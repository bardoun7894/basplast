This type of image is most commonly called Lifestyle Product Photography (or a Lifestyle Product Mockup if it was created digitally).

Specifically, in the world of marketing and design, it falls under several categories depending on how you are using it:

1. Lifestyle Product Photography
This is the professional name for showing a product in a "real-life" or stylized setting rather than just against a plain white background. It tells a story about where and how the product is used (e.g., outdoors, during a coffee break).

2. Commercial Advertising Graphic
Because it includes a logo, branding ("Saudi Made"), and product codes (BP-2619), it is technically a Product Ad or Marketing Creative. It’s designed specifically for social media (Instagram/Facebook) or catalogs.

3. 3D Product Rendering
Looking closely at the lighting and textures of the thermos in your image, it looks like a high-end 3D Render. Designers use software (like Blender or Adobe Dimension) or AI tools (like Midjourney or Flair.ai) to create these perfectly lit scenes without needing a physical camera or location.

4. Contextual Mockup
If you have a photo of a thermos and you "drop" it into a beautiful background using Photoshop, it is called a Contextual Mockup.

Summary of the "Vibe"
